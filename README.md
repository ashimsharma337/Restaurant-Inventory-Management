# Restaurant-Inventory-Management
In this repository I tried to create a Inventory app for the restaurant. In which you can create, read, update, and delete product. You can also keep track of all product with their par level. I also use Permission for different role based on their position. I use react, expressjs, nodejs, mongodb and few other technology. Hope this repo will cover the basic requirement of mern app.
