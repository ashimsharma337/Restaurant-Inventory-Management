# Restaurant-Inventory-Management
In this repository I tried to create an Inventory app for the restaurant where you can create, read, update, and delete product. You can also keep track of all product with their par level. I also use Permission for different role based on their position. I use React, expressjs, NodeJS, MongoDB and few other technologies.
